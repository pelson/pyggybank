pyggybank has the ability to:

 * Login to internet banking in a semi-automated way
    * save your credentials encrypted, and only have the ability to decrypt them when you wish (using PGP)
    * download balances and transactions
 * Handle multiple currencies and format localisation
 * Cache results to speed up subsequent retrievals (TODO)
 * Output the results into standard formats for subsequent analysis (TODO)
 * Take a simplistic view of accounts, where +$$$ is money in your pocket, and -$$$ is money out of your pocket
 * Provide a summary (one per currency) of your balance (TODO)
   * Ability to see the summary at any point in time (where records exist) and therefore see the trend of your finances + how much you're spending
 * Provide an API for 3rd party tools to extend the possible analyses and add pretty interfaces to your data (TODO)


pyggybank does not strive to:

 * Provide a rich internet banking-like web-interface
 * Interpret the data (e.g. forecasts)
 * Set up transfers, payments, direct debits or any other non read-only activity
 * Access transatction - it gets account balances only
 * Support legacy python. Python 3.6+
 * Automate sections where human-in-the-loop is required (e.g. robot detection, bespoke one-time pass code implementations)
