PLEASE NOTE: Currently it is necessary to have a recent version of gnupg (>=2.1) to be able to encrypt and decrypt accounts configs.
At some point, I will add an option to disable encryption for those on older gnupg versions.

## Can pyggybank get transactions from my bank/institution?

Almost certainly, yes! Though it may need a new provider to be added.
All of the providers that pyggybank attempts to scrape can be found at [pyggybank/providers/](pyggybank/providers).
If your provider isn't there, you will need to get a development version of pyggybank setup in order to add it
(sorry, we can't do that for you as we don't have the credentials to access accounts with your
provider otherwise we would have added it already). A guide to simplify this process will be developed (TODO).
