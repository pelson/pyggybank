# Integration tests


These tests are run using pexpect, and are designed to test the integration between pyggybank and gnupg.
Because of the cost of maintaining and runnign these tests, 100% coverage of the CLI is not sought. Instead,
we prioritise unit-testing at the python level *wherever* possible.
